\section*{Keystages}
\textcolor{red}{Time estimate from 1 to 5}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1) ] Determine roadmap (workflow) \textcolor{red}{$\sim$ 2 (?)}
\item[(2) ] Establish evaluation metrics 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(2a)] Decide which features of the neural network output to use/combine \textcolor{red}{1 - 2 }
\item[(2b)] Find appropriate metrics for different features \textcolor{red}{First metrics eval $\sim$ 2, after that maybe 3 (actually testing on real data, convergence tests, both uncertainties ...)}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1D metrics - 2D metrics
\item Stopping point/Convergence
\item Calculation time
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\item[(3) ] Find GEANT4 uncertainty \textcolor{red}{2 (this should maybe be before establishing the evaluation metrics)}
\textcolor{blue}{\item[(3*)] Bayesian Variational Autoencoder} \textcolor{red}{5 (including learning process and all, hopefully easier with Lars' knowledge)}
\begin{itemize}
\item[\textcolor{blue}{(3*a)}] \textcolor{blue}{Construct network}
\textcolor{blue}{\item[(3*b)] Combine network uncertainty with GEANT4 uncertainty}
\begin{itemize}
\item[\textcolor{blue}{*}] \textcolor{blue}{Need metric that can compare two distributions with uncertainty}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item[(4) ] Build evaluation framework \textcolor{red}{4, including the testing and everything, without the BNN-VAE}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(4a)] Testing workflow on dummy network
\textcolor{blue}{\item[(4b)] Integrate Bayesian VAE with evaluation framework} \textcolor{red}{maybe 2}
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{gray}{\item[(5) ] Integration into basf2}
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{red}{$\Rightarrow$ in total 22 units} \newline
About 42 weeks (1.5 months for writing were cut), so 1 unit $\widehat{\approx}$ 1.9 weeks \newline
\subsection*{Very rough timeline:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1) ] Mid/End July (End July is probably more realistic)
\item[(2a)] Beginning/Mid August (obv. will be revisited later on)
\item[(3) ] End August (this can be exchanged with points (2a) and (2b) )
\item[(2b)] Mid October
\item[(3*)] Beginning of January
\item[(4a)] Beginning/Mid of February
\item[(4b)] March (?)
\item[(5) ] Whatever time is left
\end{itemize}
